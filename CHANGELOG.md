## 1.1.0 - 2018-10-25

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-session-cache#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-session-cache/pull/3) adds a new constructor argument, `bool $persistent = false`. When
  this is toggled to `true`, a `Max-Age` directive will be added with a value
  equivalent to the `$cacheExpire` value. You can configure this value using the
  `mezzio-session-cache.persistent` configuration key.
